## Summer Goals:
**Learn general skills:**    
Git - analysis, lab notebook  
Shell/bash scripting  
Data analysis - R/Julia  

**Analyze echo metadata:**   
Echo - analysis of sequencing results

Analysis:  	
Converting reads into useful information (taxonomic profiles, functional profiles)  
Taxonomic profiles - what bugs are there  
Functional profiles - what genes are there  
Combine in metagenomic sequencing pipeline: connect to Harvard compute grid  

**Parse through metadata:**    
Combine meta genome with patient data  
Goal is to get plots and statistics  
Visual and numeric way to summarize data  
Wrangling, linking to patient/sample id  

**More details:**    
Add biological interpretation  
What to highlight: cool or previous literature  

Automate process   
Take reads all the way to summary statistics   
One big pipeline of pipelines   
Make the specific generic  
Command line utilities: snakemake  
Functions and packages in Julia/R
